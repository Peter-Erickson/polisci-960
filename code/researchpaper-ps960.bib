	abstract = {Military occupation is a recurrent feature of modern international politics and yet has received little attention from political scientists. This book sets out to remedy this neglect, offering:*an account of military occupation as a form of government*an assessment of key trends in the development of military occupations over the last two centuries*an explanation the conceptual and practical difficulties encountered by occupiers*examples drawn from, amongst others, the First and Second World Wars, US occupations in Latin America and Japan, the Israeli occupation of the West Bank, and the current occupation of Iraq.After a survey of the evolving practice and meaning of military occupation the book deals with its contested definitions, challenging restrictive approaches that disguise the true extent of the incidence of military occupation. Subsequent chapters explain the diverse forms that military government within occupation regimes take on and the role of civilian governors and agencies within occupation regimes; the significance of military occupation for our understanding of political obligation; the concept of sovereignty; the nature and meaning of justice; and our evaluation of regime transformation under conditions of military occupation.},

	abstract = {North Korea, despite a shattered economy and a populace suffering from widespread hunger, has outlived repeated forecasts of its imminent demise. Charles K. Armstrong contends that a major source of North Korea's strength and resiliency, as well as of its flaws and shortcomings, lies in the poorly understood origins of its system of government. He examines the genesis of the Democratic People's Republic of Korea (DPRK) both as an important yet rarely studied example of a communist state and as part of modern Korean history.North Korea is one of the last redoubts of "unreformed" Marxism-Leninism in the world. Yet it is not a Soviet satellite in the East European manner, nor is its government the result of a local revolution, as in Cuba and Vietnam. Instead, the DPRK represents a unique "indigenization" of Soviet Stalinism, Armstrong finds. The system that formed under the umbrella of the Soviet occupation quickly developed into a nationalist regime as programs initiated from above merged with distinctive local conditions. Armstrong's account is based on long-classified documents captured by U.S. forces during the Korean War. This enormous archive of over 1.6 million pages provides unprecedented insight into the making of the Pyongyang regime and fuels the author's argument that the North Korean state is likely to remain viable for some years to come.},

This study begins with an examination of Korea's modern international relations up to World War II, including Tsarist and Soviet involvement in Korea. Following that, Allied wartime negotiations on the Korean question are discussed, focusing on Stalin's goals in Korea. It then focuses on development of the Soviet occupation policy toward North Korea from the entrance of Soviet troops into North Korea to the withdrawal of its troops from North Korea in December 1948. The mechanisms the Soviets used to accomplish their goals in Korea and the role played by exogenous factors, such as U.S.-Soviet relations, in the formation of Soviet policy toward North Korea are examined particularly.
The primary methods and techniques employed in this study are the historical approach and the contextual analysis approach with the realist perspective, considering Korean internal conflicts, conflicts and compromises between the U.S. and the Soviet Union and all other variables simultaneously.
Soviet Policy toward North Korea, from the beginning of Allied wartime negotiations through the establishment of the North Korean government, was marked by a kind of slash-and-burn strategy, indicating inconsistency and imprudence. Moscow had no clear design for Korea; instead, she pursued an ill-defined policy, attempting to maintain some influence over Korea while denying complete control over the peninsula to any one power.},

	abstract = {This study analyzes the political legitimization of North Korea during 1945–1950. Two key research questions are answered: What roles the Soviet occupation authorities played in the political process of North Korea; What kind of policies and strategies did the North Korean leaders adopt to ensure their legitimacy.
To understand North Korean politics after liberation in 1945, an analysis of the Soviets' role in the process of establishing the North Korean regime is needed. When Soviet troops arrived in North Korea, the Soviet Union showed no specific interest in Korea and only acted in an ad hoc fashion in North Korea. In its efforts to end occupation of North Korea as early as possible, the Soviet Union let the North Koreans handle their own internal affairs whenever possible. The Soviets' only concern was that the new government in Korea not be hostile toward Moscow.
Political legitimization in North Korea was achieved largely by coercion, performance, and shared beliefs. In order to secure legitimacy, North Korean leaders utilized two propositions—the “anti-Japanese armed struggle” and the “creation of an independent, democratic state.” They claimed their legitimacy by stressing the crucial importance of having participated in the anti-Japanese armed struggle during the colonial period. North Korean leaders differentiated their military campaign against the Japanese from that of other patriots, arguing that the Kim Il Sung-led anti-Japanese armed struggle was the apex of the entire national independence movement. Thus, they defended their qualifications for exercising power in North Korea and their moral superiority over South Korean leaders. In Korea, the immediate task after liberation was constructing an independent, democratic state; nobody dared to challenge this proposition. Utilizing this moral obligation, North Korean leaders consolidated their power base. How effective their efforts were is a separate issue.},

	abstract = {This dissertation examines the Korean occupation policy of the Harry S. Truman administration, with special emphasis on American occupation commander General John Reed Hodge's ideas and policy recommendations to his superiors in Washington during the years 1945-1948.
During World War II, the United States projected Korea's independence only after the implementation of an international trusteeship preceded by military occupation. Because of little preparation in the War and State Departments for the occupation of Korea, Hodge suffered from the lack of guidance from Washington on such questions as Korea's eventual independence and ways of handling various political factions. Hodge had "an almost impossible task" to accomplish his political mission of establishing an independent, democratic, and united Korea. Despite strong protests from most of the Korean people regarding trusteeship, the State Department still believed in the merit of the Korean trusteeship after the termination of military government. Within a few months of occupation, however, Hodge realized that trusteeship would not solve the Korean problem and recommended that the United States abandon the trusteeship idea and pursue an agreement with the Soviet Union for a simultaneous withdrawal from Korea. The Pentagon and the Joint Chiefs of Staff shared Hodge's views, but the State Department disagreed.
The ideological confrontation between the Korean rightist and leftist groups regarding the trusteeship issue ultimately led to the failures of both the American-Soviet Joint Commission and Hodge's efforts to create a middle-of-the-road group. By early 1947, therefore, the United States gradually gave up its efforts to work with the Soviets in establishing a unified government in Korea and began to search for a "graceful" way to withdraw from the peninsula with a minimum of bad effects. The Truman administration soon found that the submission of the protracted Korean problem to the United Nations was the graceful way to get out of Korea. The decision meant the ultimate failure of the American policy in Korea. (Abstract shortened with permission of author.)},

The rise of alternative forms of public contestation, and above all, the multi-level decision-making setting of the EU, begs the question for which contemporary debates the principal–agent model still holds moral sway.

This paper presents a formal analysis of strategies that can be used to deter overly passive and overly aggressive executives and a discussion of their side effects. The typically large amount of uncertainty means that the constituency must base its decision to retain an executive on the outcome of a conflict and not on its apparent ex ante advisability. This uncertainty imposes a cost on the constituency, who may remove an effective, "innocent" executive unnecessarily, and it also imposes a cost on the well-meaning executive, who may be removed from office after making the best possible decision in a difficult case. The mechanism necessary to deter executive adventurism also causes the paradoxical "gambling for resurrection" effect, in which an unsuccessful war that a well-informed principal would terminate is continued because cessation would, given the current state of the world, cause the agent to be removed from office.},

	abstract = {The dividing line between the two Koreas was considered a temporary military expediency 67 years ago. It never disappeared, even after reshaped by battle after the Korean War. This 1945 division of Korea reflects little United States forethought about Korea's strategic position and low regard for the Korean people's ability to self-govern as an independent nation. America's designation of occupation zones in Korea was poorly handled, with enormous consequences for the Korean people. It arguably was part of a legacy of mismanaging a series of "big decisions" affecting Korea that continue to this day. The lesson of history for the U.S. is to be better informed and prepared to fulfill its responsibility toward the Korean peninsula; as a signatory to the Armistice it must be a participant in a permanent peace agreement.},

Can coalition partners hold each other's ministers accountable, or must collective government degenerate to ministerial government? In this article, I theorize about the conditions under which coalition partners should make efforts to keep tabs on each other's ministers and the ways in which they might do so. I show that parties in Italian, Dutch, and multiparty Japanese coalitions used their allotments of junior ministerial positions to shadow each other's ministers, while parties in German coalitions relied instead on institutional devices to tie ministers' hands. I also find that during the LDP's long reign as a majority party in Japan, its factions kept tabs on each other's ministers in this same way. Finally, I demonstrate that parties were more likely to keep tabs on each other's ministers for the most important ministerial portfolios.},

	abstract = {Bureaucrats perform most of the tasks of government, profoundly influencing the daily lives of Americans. But who, or what, controls what bureaucrats do? John Brehm and Scott Gates examine who influences whether federal, state, and local bureaucrats work, shirk, or sabotage policy. The authors combine deductive models and computer simulations of bureaucratic behavior with statistical analysis in order to assess the competing influences over how bureaucrats expend their efforts. Drawing upon surveys, observational studies, and administrative records of the performance of public employees in a variety of settings, Brehm and Gates demonstrate that the reasons bureaucrats work as hard as they do include the nature of the jobs they are recruited to perform and the influence of both their fellow employees and their clients in the public. In contrast to the conclusions of principal-agency models, the authors show that the reasons bureaucrats work so hard have little to do with the coercive capacities of supervisors. This book is aimed at students of bureaucracy and organizations and will be of interest to researchers in political science, economics, public policy, and sociology. "This book is breathtaking in its use of models and techniques. . . . The approach developed by Brehm and Gates allows us to re-open empirical questions that have lain dormant for years." --Bryan D.

The main focus is proconsulship in American history. Beginning with the occupation of Cuba and the Philippines after the Spanish-American War, it discusses the role of General Douglas MacArthur in East Asia during and after World War II, the occupation of Germany (focusing on General Lucius Clay), and proconsular leadership during the Vietnam War and the occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan at the turn of the twenty-first century. An additional chapter provides an overview and assessment of the evolution of American political-military command and control and decision making after the end of the Cold War"--},

These problems, coupled with allies' divergent interests, serve to weaken allied military and security forces tactically, operationally, and strategically. The ability of the United States to change its allies' behavior is limited, despite the tremendous difficulties these problems create, because relying on allied forces is a key component of U.S. strategy in the war on terrorism and the U.S. goal of handing off security to Iraqi military forces. To reduce the effects of allies' weaknesses, the United States should try to increase its intelligence on allied security forces and at times act more like a third party to a conflict. In addition, Washington must have realistic expectations of what training and other efforts can accomplish.},
